## Question about Importing Modules under Pytest

I'm converting some tests written earlier for Unittest and am having trouble with import statements when running them with Pytest.

As an example, in the older code the module `create.py` in directory `lib` might be imported as

```python
import lib.create
```

but this syntax usually raises errors when I run the code with Pytest.
